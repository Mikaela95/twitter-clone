# Twitter Clone

A foundational application that mimics Twitter

This will run the application on port 3000

### Backend

*Future work - migrate PostgreSQL to an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) or DynamoDB*
## Motivation

To develop my skills building relational databases, and explore incorporating TypeGraphQL, Apollo-server/client and TypeORM.

## User Stories

As a user I canâ€¦

*	Create an account with a unique username and password,
*	See validation errors for when a username has already been taken and when the username or password is incorrectly typed.
*	Be redirected to the home page upon successful login.
*	See previous posts created under my username,
*	Input text into a form and create this as a tweet,
*	See the latest changes of my tweet appear directly beneath the input box,
*	Delete a tweet and have that removed from the list of tweets displayed,
*	Edit a tweet, either through a modal window or separate page, and see these changes displayed in the list.
